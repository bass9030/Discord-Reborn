# Project discontinued
I decided to discontinue the project for the following reasons.

1. Skills<br>
I have never done iOS app development before, and this project was my first introduction to iOS app development and Objective-C.
I followed the official documentation and blog posts, but I had a lot of trouble finding libraries and documentation compatible with outdated iOS.

2. Development device<br>
I recently sold my 2011 MacBook Pro that I was using for development due to capital problems. I considered a hackintosh as an alternative, but my main PC has an AMD CPU and an Nvidia GPU, so a hackintosh is not possible, and my laptop does not support macOS, so I cannot continue development anymore.

Thanks for your patience with this project, and we apologize for the inconvenience.
